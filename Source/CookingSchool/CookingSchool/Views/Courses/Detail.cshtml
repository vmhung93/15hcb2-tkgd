                        Some restaurant dishes are best left to professional kitchens.
                        Other restaurant dishes might seem daunting for the home cook, but that's only because you have never seen the dish made.
                        Chinese dumplings and potstickers are a perfect example of this second group.
                        Yes, stuffing and sealing the wrappers takes some patience, but with just 20 minutes of work you can have dumplings ready for cooking in your own kitchen.
                        All of the recipes in this course freeze beautifully too, so you can always have dumplings on hand. <br /><br />

                        In this course, you will learn how to prepare steamed Chinese pork and shrimp dumplings, known as shu mai, with a chili oil dipping sauce.
                        You will also learn how to make pork and cabbage potstickers with a flavorful scallion dipping sauce as well as vegetarian mushroom and cabbage potstickers.
